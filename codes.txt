1) Write a program to add 8 to the number 2345 and then divide it by 3. Now, the modulus of the quotient is taken with 5 and then multiply theresultant value by 5. Display the final result.(Using Assignment Operators)

package Assignment;
public class Operators {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int number = 2345;
        number += 8;
        number /= 3;
        number %= 5;
        number *= 5;
        System.out.println("Final result: " + number);

	}

}
